# cpp-argparse
Parsing command line args in C++. Because I can't just use Python's ArgParse...

## Don't @ Me, Bro
This isn't feature-complete. It might not "work". It might not do anything helpful. Don't send me a pull-request; I'm just trying to learn C++ over here.

## Use
1. Build the library with `make lib` (or just do it by hand, it's only two commands)
1. `#include "argparse.hpp"`
1. Link with `-L {dir} -largparse` (for this example, use `make main`)
